# BankCustomerChurn
# Python
Conducted Chi-Square, T-test, and ANOVA tests to analyze customer behavior in relation to churn. The p-value across tests was consistently less
than 2.2e-16, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Age emerged as the most significant predictor with an F-value of 898.271,
explaining a significant portion of variability in customer churn. Using Logistic Regression, achieved a predictive accuracy of 91% in determining
customer likelihood to file a complaint, highlighting "Complain" as a highly significant predictor (p < 0.001), strongly associated with customer
attrition from the bank.
